## What's a shift cipher?
A shift cipher, also known as a [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) because Julius Caesar used it, encrypts a message by replacing each letter with another letter that is a number of positions later in the alphabet. For example, shifting 2 positions would substitute 'A' with 'C,' 'B' with 'D,' and so on, with 'Y' and 'Z' going back to the beginning of the alphabet.

## Setup
